        My Goal
      </h4>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to become a developer and maybe I can combine this and my accounting profession to create something unique. Depending on my financial situation, if I had to keep my accounting career pathway, I’ll see if I can work on any small projects as a contractor. Otherwise, the plan is to switch my career path right after this Bootcamp. Either way, I will stick to my long term goal.      </p>
    <h4>Pros and Cons</h4>
      <p>
        There are some attributes of me that will be quite helpful in surviving, or thriving (even better), this foundation and Bootcamp. I have strong self-motivation and I can handle stress well. I can focus on learning for hours and not feel exhausted. In fact, I get excited because I grow as I learn. However, sometimes I get lost in details. It could cost me a couple of hours before I realize that. This habit is not affordable during Bootcamp given how intense it would be. I am on a solution - I’ve been using Toggl since the start of the foundation to correct this habit of mine.    </p>
        <p>When it comes to teamwork during the Bootcamp, there is one skill that I definitely need to improve on. That is my communication. I tend to under-communicate. I assume people have the same level of information and come from the same background as I do. I know that over-communication is the key to achieving any teamwork and this is an obstacle that I must overcome.</p>
        <p>I am a practical person and I know how to arrange my time. I keep a priority list based on the deadline and importance of each task. As for team projects, I’ll do the same plus share my priority list and live progress tracker with my teammates and my facilitators if necessary.</p>
        <p>If things are building up and starting to get to me, I will take a 20 minutes break to go for a walk or talk to a friend or even just sit in the backyard and look at the sky. This has been extremely helpful to take the stress off me or when I get irritated by something. When I start to take my 20 minutes break often, this will be a signal for me to reach out for help. I think twice a day can be the signal. In addition, I do 3 or 4 times exercises per week to keep myself pumped, both physically and emotionally.</p>
    <h4>Potential Help Needed</h4>
      <p>
        I expect some general guidance when I get lost in the program or when I start to think small of myself. Some cheering words from time to time can be nice - unexpected praise or recognition can make someone’s day.          </p>
        <p>There shouldn’t be any block-out times during my Bootcamp journey. By the time we start BootCamp, my preschooler will be schooling and my baby will be attending daycare. My husband will do all the drop-offs and pick-ups. If occasionally he can’t do it, I will let the team and my facilitator know. Although, if anything goes sideways, I will reach out to my facilitator immediately to seek advice.</p>
