        <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
        <p>
            IQ decides whether you are a fast learner, whether you can understand and apply high-level academic knowledge, or whether you can provide the best solution to a complex job at work. IQ is important because it decides the top ceiling of your academic achievement or your efficiency level at work. 
        </p>
        <p>
           EQ decides whether you can handle the stress well, whether you can control your own emotions, whether you can wipe out the negativity and conflict in any circumstances. EQ is the key to thriving in life.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
        <p>
            Most people in the world share an average level of IQ, which means the top ceilings of our potential achievements are the same or close enough. But why do failures and criminals exist? Why are some people living a happier life whilst others are surviving the miserable? It is EQ that differentiates the average us into many different groups. To put it in a simple term, the group with higher EQ thrives, the group with lower EQ survives or suffers.
